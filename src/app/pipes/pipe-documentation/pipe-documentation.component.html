    <div body>
        <p>By "flattening" an array, we mean taking a multidimensional array and turning it into a regular "single"
            dimensional array.</p>
        <h6 class="heading">Pipe Pure is set to "false"</h6>
        <small>An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameter(s)
            changes.</small>
        <p> {{ flattenData | flatten }} </p>
        <h6 class="heading">Pipe Pure is set to "true"</h6>
        <small>A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a
            pipe.</small>
        <p> {{ flattenData }} </p>

        <P>This is relevant for changes that are not detected by Angular. When you pass an array or object that got the
            content changed (but is still the same instance)</P>

        <small>Note: Pipe Pure is set to "true" by default. If a property in this pipe "xxx | filter" is an array and an item gets added or removed, then a
            pure pipe won't be called because Angular doesn't recognize xxx as changed because it's the same xxx (with a
            different content though). If you make it pure: false then Angular doesn't care whether xxx has changed or
            not its transform() method is called much more often every time a change detection is executed. So impure
            pipe executes everytime irrespective of source has changed or not. which leads to bad performance. </small>
